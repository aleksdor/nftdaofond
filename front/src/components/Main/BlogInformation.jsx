                                Floros.club is an experimental project that has the goal to unify the top solutions for different types of DAO management and expansion. We aim to create a project controlled and developed by the token holders in a way that can unify the efficient management of assets and the NFT auction model open for the community by applying a structure where all community members matter and feel that their participation is needed.

                                            The Auction Contract applied at Floros.club will act as a self-sufficient token generation and distribution mechanism, with the auctions starting within the predetermined periods of 24/48 hours in between. All the income generated will be directly deposited to the DAO Vault (100% of the ETH assets or other assets after conversion to ETH) and further funds governance is applied by the token holders.

                                            The settlement of the auction automatically activates the next auction by generating (minting) a new NFT Token for Floros.club.

                                            While the settlement of the auction is bound to be incentivized for the winning bidder, it can be triggered by any new or existing member, allowing the Auction Platform to trustlessy auction Floros.club NFTs as long as the Ethereum network is operational and interested bidders are present.

                                            Floros.club DAO is running via the Compound Governance as the main governing body of the community ecosystem. DAO Vault hereby receives 100% of the incoming assets from th auctions to further process it. Each of the NFT holders automatically becomes a irrevocable member of the DAO governing community with each NFT token being equal to 1 vote. Votes acquired with the NFT token acquisition are delegatable but not transferable. A member can delegate their vote to someone as long as he owns the NFT token, but selling the token leads to the vote going with it.

                                            Even though Compoung Governance offers a wide range of security measures and options, NFT holders, which are by default members of the Floros Club, have an additional instrument of the veto. It can, and must, be used as a precautionary measure against malicious and non-profitable proposals for the period where the token supply is low. Veto right is a measure that can be used only as last resort in cases where such proposals have been passed under any circumstances.

                                            Club members will revoke the veto right when the majority of the community deems that it is safe to do so.

                                            Floros.club NFT Tokens are always generated randomly based on the block hashes of the Ethereum network.

                                            The NFTs generated for the Floros Club members are stored directly on the Ethereum Network, therefore no pointers such as the IPFS are used. Parts of the NFT are compressed and stored on-chain using a customly made Run Length Encoding (RLE), which is considered a lossless compression. All the compressed parts are then converted into a single base64 encoded SVG image by decoding each part into an intermediate format before using the on-chain string concatenation to generate the full SVG image, encoded via base64 standard.

                                            The Seeder Contract is used to determine certain traits of the NFT minted. It can be replaced to allow future trait generation algorithm updates, or can be locked by the Floros Club DAO to prevent the updates. Current NFT traits are determined using a pseudo-random generation of numbers via the following codeline:
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <code>keccak256(abi.encodePacked(blockhash(block.number - 1), floroId))</code>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Trait generation is not truly random. Traits can be predicted during the minting in accordance with the blocks of Ethereum Network used.
